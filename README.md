# Digital Filter Designer

Design a custom digital filter via zeros-poles placement on the z-plane, and apply an all-pass filter to correct the phase. You can either browse a signal or create one using vertical mouse strokes.

## Features

- [x] Add zeros or poles
- [x] Drag them or delete them
- [x] Add conjugates for existing or new zeros/poles
